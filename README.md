# My PortFolio
Portfolio site made by following Scrimba 'Build and Deploy a Portfolio site' 
# Introduction
  The purpose of this project was threefold. I wanted practice in building a portfolio website, have a template to showcase my projects, and learn more about responsive web design. I wanted to do all of this in a way to learn best practices.
